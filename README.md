Characterizing the microbiota of the threatened southern sea otter (_Enhydra lutris nereis_) to enhance conservation practice. Under review at Conservation Science and Practice (2021).

Southern sea otters are a threatened keystone sub-species in coastal ecosystems. To understand better the role of diet, monitor health, and enhance management of this and other marine mammal species, we characterized the oral and distal gut microbiota of 158 wild southern sea otters (_Enhydra lutris nereis_) living off the coast of central California, USA, 13 captive sea otters (some of which participated in a diet shift experiment), and 17 otters from three other otter species.

### Installation

Coming soon...

### How to run

1. format_ds.Rmd -> Generate a phyloseq object for lane 1 dataset, calculate some basic stats relating to the wild sea otter samples analyzed here (# samples, ASVs, etc), generate ASV tables at genus level for gingival and rectal samples from wild sea otters (save as csv req'd plotting Figure 2A,B)
2. full_dataset_stats.Rmd -> Generate useful statistics for the full dataset used in this project (total # samples in the project, including wild sea otters, captive sea otters, other otter species, etc)
3. 

More coming soon...
